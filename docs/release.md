# Release automation (summary)

Releases are produced by `googleapis/release-please-action`. The release workflow has been refactored so release steps are defined in `.github/workflows/release-shared-steps.yml` and invoked by a small top-level caller (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) which prefers hosted runners and falls back to `self-hosted` when the top-level try job fails.

- Trigger: push to `main`.
- Behavior: `googleapis/release-please-action` parses Conventional Commits and will open/update Release PRs or create a release when appropriate; it also generates/updates the changelog (`CHANGELOG.md`) and exposes outputs such as `release_created`, `major`, `minor`, `patch`, `tag_name`, and `body`.
- CI integration: the shared-step workflow consumes those outputs to tag versions and to build/push container images (see the repository workflows for exact steps). The hosted-first / self-hosted fallback may cause duplicate PR checks to appear when the fallback runs — this is cosmetic.

## Notes for maintainers

- Review the draft release or Release PR produced by the action, add concise highlights or migration notes, then publish/merge.
- Do not commit a handwritten `CHANGELOG.md` to the repository; rely on per-release notes generated by the action.
