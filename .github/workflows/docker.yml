    # NOTE: This fallback job runs only when the `try_docker` job fails.
    #
    # Because both the try and fallback invoke the same reusable workflow, the
    # GitHub PR UI may display duplicated or expanded workflow sections. In
    # addition, using `continue-on-error` inside the reusable jobs can make
    # checks appear as failed in the PR interface even though the fallback
    # subsequently handled the failure. This is a cosmetic artifact of the
    # try→fallback pattern and does not indicate a functional regression.
