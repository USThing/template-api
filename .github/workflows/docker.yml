  # NOTE: Do not set `continue-on-error: true` on the `detect-quota` job.
  # If `continue-on-error` is enabled the job result will always be
  # 'success', which defeats detection (we rely on `needs.detect-quota.result`).
  # Unfortunately this means the workflow may be reported as failed if the
  # hosted runner is unavailable. We cannot work around this until GitHub
  # provides a job-level "allow-failure"/neutral-conclusion feature
  # (see: https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/2347 for discussion).
